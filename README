README for ELab::Client
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ELab::Client, based on REST::Client [1], provides methods to access an eLabFTW
electronic lab notebook server [2] via its REST API [3]. The targetted
functionality is identical to the official "elabapy" Python client [4].
(That shouldn't keep us from making the package better though!)
